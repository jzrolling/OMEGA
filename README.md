## Introduction

OMEGA (or Open source, Mycobacterial-Enhanced Graphic Analysis toolkit) is a python based image analysis toolkit optimized for dealing with mycobacterial cells. Given a single or a set of fluorescent microscopic image(s), OMEGA renders accurate object segmentation and graphical representation of fluroescent or morphological profiles at both the single cell level and the populational level. OMEGA was developed to analyze a *M. smegmatis* fluorsecent protein tagging library (Mycobacterial Systems Resource, Dendra, or MSR-Dendra) which accounts for over 1,000 highly conserved mycobacterial genes. You may find the MSR-Dendra dataset (along with many other amazing mycobacterial resources) on this [website](http://msrdb.org/). 

## Warning: OMEGA is still under development, please use with caution. ##

## Installation

To install OMEGA from the Python Package index (PyPi) , make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/), then run:

    $ pip install omega-micro
    
A Jupyter notebook based [tutorial](https://github.com/jzrolling/OMEGA/blob/master/Notebooks/1.%20OMEGA%20workbench.ipynb) is included.
